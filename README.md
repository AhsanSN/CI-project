# Fuzzy Logic for Course Grade Calculation
## Computational Intelligence

### Problem/Motivation:

The current method for calculating GPA is extremely unjust for students that have percentages very close to percentages that can change their grade for the better. Similarly, in the current method of calculating GPA, a student with 80 and other with 89.9 are considered equal, whereas we know this is actually not the case. The proposed paper will seek a method that will compute course grades based on fuzzy rules. The main aim of this method will be to get rid of the so-called â€œbump" percentages. In the current method, scores as far as 9.99 percent apart may be considered the same grade. The grade obtained by this method is a poor representation of the percentage earned in a particular course.

### Dataset

After the system will be ready it will be tested with some data. A grades of all the course in the previous semester of some Habib university students will be gathered, and their computed GPA will be compared with the GPA calculated using the traditional method to find the trends.

### Expected Outcome

A method implemented on a website to compute GPA for any arbitrary list of grades based on Fuzzy mathematics. The whole system will have two layers. First one is where the instructors directly put in the overall percentages of the course obtained by a particular student, and the final GPA is calculated based on that. The second layer that is optional to use, but a professor may use is, instead of directly putting in the overall percentage, the professor can put in marks on assignments, percentages, quizzes, exams, etc. for a course, and the overall course percentage is calculated based on that data using fuzzy logic. After the system will be ready it will be tested with some data. A grades of all the course in the previous semester of some Habib university students will be gathered, and their computed GPA will be compared with the GPA calculated using the traditional method to find the trends.
